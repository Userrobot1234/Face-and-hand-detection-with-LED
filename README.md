# Face-and-hand-detection-with-LED
This code shows contours of the face and the hand. If you show your hand up it will on the main LED via Arduino board and keep the alternate LED off. If you show your hand down, then it will switch on the alternate LED and off the main LED.

If you also want to make this project you will need:-

Arduino Uno(or any arduino board of your choice)

A Few LED's

A few jumper wires

That's all you need to make this project

If your in-built LED is not working, then you can use another LED in place of the non-working one
